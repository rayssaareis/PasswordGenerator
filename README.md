# 🔐 Password Generator – Multi-Word Diceware Passwords 🎲

![Screenshot_1.png](Screenshot_1.png)

A secure, multi-word password generator built in Java, inspired by the Diceware method.  
This project was created as a personal learning exercise in Java development, focusing on modular design, user input handling, and clean separation of concerns between logic and UI.

## Overview
🎯 High-entropy, multi-word password generation using the Diceware methodology.

This project generates secure passwords composed of multiple words selected from a Diceware word list. Each word is generated by simulating the roll of five dice, producing passwords that are both secure and memorable.

The generator includes:
- 💻 User-friendly command-line interface  
- ✅ Input validation for number of words  
- ⏱️ Step-by-step generation with optional delays (learning-oriented)  
- 🧠 Encouragement to create mnemonic stories for memorization

## Inspiration
💡 Real-world security concepts applied through hands-on Java development.

The idea for this project came while watching a video by Bruno Fraga:  
[Crie a SENHA MAIS SEGURA do mundo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYEcsHYTFrI&t=8s)

The goal was to **automate the Diceware process**, transforming a manual security practice into a clean, testable, and reusable Java application.

## Features
✨ Focused on security, clarity, and learning.

- 🔑 Generates passwords with a configurable number of words  
- 🎲 Uses `SecureRandom` for cryptographically strong dice rolls  
- 👀 Displays dice rolls and word mapping (educational, optional)  
- ⚡ Lightweight Java console application  
- 🛡️ Encourages secure password creation practices  

> 💡 Tip: For higher security, use more than three words and build a short mnemonic story.

## Technical Details
🛠️ Java-focused design with clear separation of concerns.

- **Language:** Java 17+  
- **Application Type:** Console-based  

### Main Components
- `PasswordGenerator` – application entry point and execution loop  
- `Paorsswd` – password generation and dice roll logic  
- `DicewareRepository` – loads and maps the Diceware word list  
- `ConsoleUI` – handles user input, menus, validation, and delays  

### Design Decisions
- 🔹 Clear separation between UI and business logic  
- 🔹 Encapsulated input handling and sleep logic for readability  
- 🔹 Secure random number generation via `SecureRandom`  
- 🔹 Input validation to prevent invalid or unsafe configurations

## Diceware Word List
📜 Based on the official Diceware word list (7,776 words).

Each line contains a five-digit dice key followed by its corresponding word.
